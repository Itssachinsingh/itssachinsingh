- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" to describe a flaw in a computer program dates back to 1947. Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. She famously taped the moth in her logbook, noting "First actual case of bug being found". Since then, "debugging" has been a common term in programming for fixing errors in code.😄
